1. Board representation - I have decided to represent the board using a simple
one-dimensional array by mapping the indexes to each of the slots on the board like so:
_____________
|_0_|_1_|_2_|
|_3_|_4_|_5_|
|_6_|_7_|_8_|
If the board state was like the following:
_____________
|_o_|_-_|_x_|
|_-_|_-_|_-_|
|_-_|_x_|_-_|
In addition, instead of storing strings, it was more efficent to represent them as integers so that it is easier to determine if someone is winning. Therefore, 'x' will be player 1 or integer 1, 'o' will be player 2 or integer 2 and '-' will be intereg 0 since no move has been placed. Then, the API will store it as [2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0] and it would return the following string as response to an API call: "2,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0". Then, the whichever platform calling the endpoint would have to interpret the board. 

Users making a move will simply enter the index of the board to make their move. 

2. Scoring will simply count the number of moves made by each player. Since having smaller moves means that the player is more skillful in Tic Tac Toe, the return values for getHighScores API method will be sorted in reverse order starting with the player who won with the least moves
